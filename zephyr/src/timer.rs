//! Zephyr timers
//!
//! This provides a relatively high-level and almost safe interface to Zephyr's underlying
//! `k_timer`.
//!
//! Every timer starts as a [`StoppedTimer`], which has been allocated, but is not tracking any
//! time.  These can either be created through [`StoppedTimer::new`], or by calling `.init_once(())` on a
//! StaticStoppedTimer declared within the `kobject_define!` macro, from [`object`].
//!
//! The `StoppedTimer` has two methods of interest here:
//!
//! - [`start_simple`]: which starts the timer.  This timer has methods for robustly getting counts
//!   of the number of times it has fired, as well as blocking the current thread for the timer to
//!   expire.
//! - [`start_callback`]: which starts the timer, registering a callback handler.  This timer will
//!   (unsafely) call the callback function, from IRQ context, every time the timer expires.
//!
//! Both of these returned timer types [`SimpleTimer`] and [`CallbackTimer`] have a [`stop`] method
//! that will stop the timer, and give back the original `StoppedTimer`.
//!
//! All of the types implement `Drop` and can dynamic timers can be safely dropped.  It is safe to
//! drop a timer allocated through the static object system, but it will then not be possible to
//! re-use that timer.
//!
//! [`object`]: crate::object
//! [`start_simple`]: StoppedTimer::start_simple
//! [`start_callback`]: StoppedTimer::start_callback
//! [`stop`]: SimpleTimer::stop
