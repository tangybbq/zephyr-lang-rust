//! Close-to-Zephyr channels
//!
//! This module attempts to provide a mechanism as close as possible to `crossbeam-channel` as we
//! can get, directly using Zephyr primitives.
//!
//! The channels are built around `k_queue` in Zephyr.  As is the case with most Zephyr types,
//! these are typically statically allocated.  Similar to the other close-to-zephyr primitives,
//! this means that there is a constructor that can directly take one of these primitives.
//!
//! In other words, `zephyr::sys::Queue` is a Rust friendly implementation of `k_queue` in Zephyr.
//! This module provides `Sender` and `Receiver`, which can be cloned and behave as if they had an
//! internal `Arc` inside them, but without the overhead of an actual Arc.
